### Things I achieved in 2.25hrs

1. Created my first Vue Application with TypeScript
2. Added Vuetify as a styling component based library
3. Added Vuex and a prototype of a store with users
4. A basic flow showing an initial call with Vuex to an api and returning a list of users as the main page.
5. As a bonus, added Vue chrome extension showing Component and Vuex store structure.

### Things to look into

1. Proper structure of vuex
2. Mapping getters (equivalent of Redux selectors) in components with typescript
3. SSR
4. Production build
5. Unit tests
6. Better UI structure of components (including use of scss)
